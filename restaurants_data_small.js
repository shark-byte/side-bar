The bed was comfortable but the shower tub situation sucks it's totally old school and for a place of this caliber you would expect to have had a remodel. There are no lights in the closet so it's hard to see your clothes. Not a lot of outlets to plug your stuff in. It's just didn't feel like they were that interested in making sure we were comfortable from a room standpoint once again the staff was amazing and they were all super nice and tell you about the hotel itself",
